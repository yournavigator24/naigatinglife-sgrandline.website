    <blockquote>
        <p>"When do you think a person dies? When a bullet from a pistol pierces his heart? No. When he's attacked by an incurable disease? No. When he eats a soup of deadly poisonous mushrooms? No. A man dies when people forget him!"</p>
        <i>~ Dr. Hiriluks</i>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <p>"There comes a time when a man must stand and fight. And that is when his friends' dreams are being laughed at!"</p>

        <i>~ Bon Clay</i>
        <p>"The one who wins will rewrite the definition of right and wrong. They'll decide the future and how the past is written... The winner will define the meaning of justice!"</p>
        <i>~ Donquixote Doflamingo</i>
        <p>"If we lose credibility just by admitting fault, then we didn't have any in the first place."</p>
        <i>~ Admiral Fujitora</i>
        <p>"Nobody decides to die because they want to. Most death is unexpected and unwanted."</p>
